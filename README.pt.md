# Coffee Shop Sales Analysis

This project is an exploratory data analysis (EDA) of sales data from a coffee shop, covering the period from January to June 2023. The goal is to extract actionable business insights by analyzing revenue, products, and consumer behavior patterns.

## üéØ Objective

1.  Which are the months with the highest and lowest revenue?
2.  What are the best-selling product categories?
3.  On which days of the week does the coffee shop sell the most?

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools Used
* **Python** as the programming language
* **Pandas** for data cleaning and manipulation
* **Matplotlib** & **Seaborn** for data visualization
* **Jupyter Notebook / Google Colab** as the development environment

**Insight:** Revenue grew consistently from January to May, which was the peak month of the semester. June saw a slight decrease, suggesting an opportunity to investigate and perhaps launch marketing campaigns to sustain growth in the second half of the year.

### 2. Best-Selling Product Categories

**Insight:** "Caf√©" (Coffee) is the absolute leading category, confirming the business's core product is performing well. "Ch√°" (Tea) and "Padaria" (Bakery) are the next most popular, indicating great potential for creating bundled deals (combos) to increase the average ticket value per customer.

### 3. Sales by Day of the Week

**Insight:** The coffee shop has a strong and steady flow of customers throughout the week, with a peak on Mondays. Saturdays show a slight dip, presenting an opportunity for specific promotions (like a "Saturday Brunch") to boost customer traffic.
